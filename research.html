        <h2>Current Lab Group</h2>
        <p>I am currently an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Dan Reichart's lab working on gamma ray bursts (GRBs), 
            the Jovian magnetosphere, Astromancer, and Skynet 2!
            <br>
            <br>
            Our current work is focused on modeling stellar winds with respect to two parameters -- wind velocity
            and mass loss. We can learn what stars lead to certain prescriptions of stellar winds by constraining 
            these two parameters. Using a well defined physical GRB model and afterglow observations, we can learn 
            what stellar winds are required to create the observed afterglow. This method offers us a possible 
            window into the composition and metallicity of early universe stars.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am also very interested interested in what can be learned from the decimetric observations of 
            the Jovian magnetosphere from Earth observation. High cadence observations in 1.3 to 8 GHz has not been 
            conducted on the order of multiple recordings per day. I am curious as to what these high cadence 
            observations may reveal about solar flare forcing or plasma transport instabilities.
            <br>
            <br>
            Skynet 2 is robotic telescope network that aims to provide access to optical and radio telescopes to
            students, professors, amateurs, and researchers. Skynet currently boasts 19 optical telescopes and 1 radio 
            telescope with 3 more radio telescopes joining in the latter half of 2025.

                    Sources were identified and small manual WCS corrections were made using the Radio Source Finder tool in Astromancer. The images 
                    were then stitched together in Afterglow, an image processing interface.

            <br>
            I also created a tool on an educational astronomy suite named Astromancer. My tool was responsible for 
            processing radio images and then locating radio sources within these radio images. The images are fitted 
            to a Flamsteed projection so that every area has equal flux. Radio maps were then taken to be stitched 
            together with manual WCS corrections completed within the tool. All sources were then labeled in the so-called 
            mega map across the galactic plane in radio wavelengths.

        <h2>RIOS REU</h2>
        <p>In summer 2024, I participated in the Research Internships for Ocean Sciences (RIOS) Research Experience 
            for undergraduates (REU) at Rutgers New Brunswick. I was mentored by professor Dr. Karen Bemis on 
            analyzing and detecting hydrothermal plumes using a tank located at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). 
            <br>
            <br>
            My work was focused on creating 2D and 3D data visualizations that would best qualitatively assess hydrothermal plumes. 
            This included: creating static 2D plots of slices of our data, animating across a range of slices, and making heat map averages 
            of the plumes.
            <br>
            <br>

                These two animations are from an array of thermal emitting devices that create a "man-made hydrothermal vent". This array 
                was used for diagnostic testing to ensure we were visualizing the plume correctly.

            <br>
            The end result of the project led to a GitHub repo with a lightweight software application for students to 
            familiarize themselves with hydrothermal plume data and for researchers to quickly assess plumes while 
            on research cruises.

        <h2>ERIRA</h2>
        <p>I was a participant in the Educational Research in Radio Astronomy (ERIRA) program in 2023. This program gives students 
            the opportunity to learn about radio astronomy in an intensive week long program. During the program I particpated in 
            projects including:
            <br>
            <br>
            • Astrophotography
            <br>
            • Mapping the Milky Way
            <br>
            • Sensing sunspots
            <br>
            • Recording Cas A
