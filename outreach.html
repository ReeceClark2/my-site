        <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
        Throughout my time at UNC Chapel Hill, I have tried to be an active participant in our chapter's 
        outreach programs. I participated in local STEAM nights at elementary and middle schools, volunteered
        at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS) during Astronomy Days, aided with other events, and
        generally tried to aid our community in engaging with physics amongst other events. Many of these initiatives 
        can be found on my CV.
        <br>
        <br>
        I held the position of outreach coordinator for my Society of Physics Students (SPS) chapter 
        during my 3rd year. During my position, I continued to participate in the previously listed programs  
        in addition to being the head of our chapter's outreach board and member of the broader Physics and Astronomy
        Department Outreach Board. In the year prior to my appointment, a program was spearheaded for weekly volunteer 
        days at the UNC Hospital School for physics demonstrations. I ensured this continued, and it is probably 
        the initiative I am most proud of maintaining! It is awesome.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also became the project lead for a Marsh White Award for a physics outreach program titled "VisPys" for 
        hands-on physics workshops. This series of three workshops emphasized simple interest in physics for the 
        non-physics major. We created crafts and demonstrations for those who participated. Unfortunately, the third 
        workshop was not get completed in time for this series, but its product will still be used in future workshops.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, I am very proud of the outreach I have been able to lead as a member of the physics community! I look
        forward to continuing projects such as these because science should not be "scary" or "intimidating".
