      <main>
        I try to maintain at least some hobbies! Primarily, this includes running and crafting.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Running</h2>
        I love to do long distance running. My goal (in a few years) is to complete a 100 mile race.
        I have currently ran two marathons, but I hope to break into the ultramarathon category when I 
        am a little more prepared and the weather is a little less scorching.

        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Baking</h2>
        Baking is something I like to do, albeit very frustrating to mess up. Even so, it is a very rewarding (and tasty)
        hobby. I love to make pretzels, bagels, pies, etc.

        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Crafting</h2>
        My go to craft is most likely embroidery, but really any cute idea I can find on my Pinterest becomes
        a possible goto for my next project. I like to use the things I make whether it be macrame plant hangers or
        bookmarks to just embroideries to put on the wall.
